                The Hulk is a fictional superhero appearing in publications by the American
                publisher Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, 
                the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). 
                In his comic book appearances, the character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, 
                hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, 
                and his alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, 
                and emotionally reserved physicist. The two exist as independent dissociative personalities, 
                and resent each other.

                Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays saving the life of Rick Jones during
                the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the
                Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often leading to 
                destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's 
                level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. 
                Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other 
                personalities based on Banner's fractured psyche, from a mindless, destructive force, 
                to a brilliant warrior, or genius scientist in his own right. 
                Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. 
                This includes Banner's lover Betty Ross, his best friend Rick Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, and 
                therapist and ally Doc Samson. In addition, the Hulk alter ego has many key supporting characters 
                like his co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers, his queen Caiera, fellow warriors 
                Korg and Miek, and sons Skaar and Hiro-Kala. However, his uncontrollable power has brought 
                him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others. 
                Despite this he tries his best to do what's right while battling villains such as Leader, 
                Abomination, Absorbing Man and more.

                Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.

                The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a nearly indestructible shield that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young artist enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the military to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure in his community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.

                Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.

                A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.
